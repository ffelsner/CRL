GetComponents
==========================================
GetComponents is a tool designed to facilitate the task of retrieving
a large set of software components from multiple versioning systems.
Currently it supports cvs, svn, git, mercurial, darcs, and http/ftp checkouts
and updates. It is based on the GetCactus tool that was designed for the
Cactus Framework, however GetComponents is designed as a general-purpose
tool. To use GetComponents, you must have a component list in the Component
Retrieval Language (CRL), which has been designed in conjunction with
GetComponents.
